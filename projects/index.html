		<h3>Technical information</h3>
		- Abstraction of extra product data (json)
		- DB optimization with json and transient
		- Form inheritance
		- Form and design abstraction from product
        - AWS SDK and Google Api as SaaS used
		- WordPress and Woocommerce was used due to
		* speed prototyping, better control
		* server support (LightSpeed, Cloud caching)
		* plug-ins (LightSpeed, Wordfence)
		* future development => headless WordPress

        Below you can find explanation of the above "technical information" in more wast-my-time manner:
        Abstraction for Enhanced Flexibility and Scalability

        We employed a robust abstraction layer to manage extra product data, ensuring flexibility and maintainability. By leveraging (confidential data here), we were able to efficiently store and retrieve additional information associated with products.

        Form Inheritance for Consistent User Experience

        To maintain a consistent user experience across different product types, we implemented form inheritance. This allowed us to create reusable form templates and customize them for specific products, reducing development time and ensuring a cohesive user interface.

        Product-Centric Design

        Our product development approach prioritized abstraction between form and design elements, enabling us to easily modify and update both without affecting the core functionality. This modular structure facilitated rapid iterations and customization.

        Leveraging WordPress and WooCommerce

        We chose WordPress and WooCommerce as the foundation for our product development due to their:

        Speed and Efficiency: Their performance-focused architecture and extensive plugin ecosystem accelerated development and deployment.
        Server Support: Integration with LightSpeed and cloud caching solutions ensured optimal performance and scalability.
        Plugin Ecosystem: Access to a vast library of plugins for added functionality and customization.
        Future-Proofing: The potential to transition to a headless WordPress architecture for enhanced flexibility and decoupled frontend development.
        By combining these strategies, we were able to create a scalable, maintainable, and highly customizable product development platform.
