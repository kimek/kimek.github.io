<p>Refactor live site from Vanilla JS to use Vue.js 3.5</p>


<p><a href="https://yorkman.co.uk/keystonelaw/vue.html" target="_blank" >Vue project</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.keystonelaw.com/lawyers" target="_blank" >Original page</a></p>
<pre>
Report details:
Time taken: 2 days ( 1 days analazing code, css, current issues and prototyping, gathering data ; 2 day implementation and coding )
Vue version: 3.5

Overall page performance:
- First page view load 2 times faster than original
- User to page interaction waiting time decreased 2.5 times.
- Faster rendering and improved responsiveness.
- Enhanced the visual appeal and readability for clients 

Technical:
- Page is using Vue.js 3.5
- Instant update on search due to loaded all 540 records (in contrary to original page)
- No page refresh (in contrary to original page)
- No additional server call (in contrary to original page)
- "What are you looking for" searching term is based on lawyer name. Extending the option to bio is 1 min job.
- "What are you looking for" searching term works with alphabetic search term
-  Alphabetic filter is dynamic, based on 540 records  (in contrary to original page)
-  Alphabetic filter is multi-choice  (in contrary to original page)
- Instant update of Result records value
- Instant hiding Next Page / Previous page if there is only one page
- Instant disabling Next Page / Previous page if there is no more pages to show (probably I should hide them instead of blocking)
- Instant hiding pagination on empty results
- Instant message  "No Lawyers found." on empty results
- Simple 1 line configuration for: record per page, feed url
- Placeholder image support (in contrary to original page) (ex. branding logo of KeyStone here)
- Responsive image support
- Readable 100 lines of code only 
- Animation on add/removal when filtering (in contrary to original page) and easy customization
- No 3rd additional part libraries needed ( only vue, no masonry or  waypoint needed )
- No waypoint neither calculation of height of dom needed - fast page painting 

Visual:
- More aesthetic layout 
- Used native sticky (support since May 2021) and flex (support since May 1998) for layout and fast painting.
- No height calculation or javascript needed.
- Responsiveness (works on mobile and desktop)
- Issue fixed: 
*height of record 
*height of filter
*slow page painting - now is fast and smooth
